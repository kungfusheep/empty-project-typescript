# empty-project-typescript
An empty typescript project that's ready to go for browser-based projects.

After running `npm install` you'll have a gulp script that deals with your TypeScript build, browser-sync and file watching. There's also a `tsconfig.json` with some default values populated. 

Just clone and get coding!
